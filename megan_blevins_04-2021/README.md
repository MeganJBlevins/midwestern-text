### Communication

Good morning {{ assistant name }}!
   I'm a developer on the Midwestern Interactive team working with {{ company name }} to {{ project here: ex: 'build your website' }}. 
   I'm ready to start working with your current code, but need access to it before I can start. We'd prefer to use FTP to access your code base so we can work with it.
   Do you  happen to know the credentials to access your code through FTP? Those credenttials include a host/url, username and password, and you might find more information 
   on that on your {{ hosting url, or more host information }} account. If you're unable to find those, I'd be happey to jump on a quick call or zoom to 
   go through what information you have and see if we can find them! Just let me know if you need more information from me. I look forward to working with you through this project! 

   Warm Regards,
   Megan Blevins

### Code Test

This was fun to put together! Next is definitely familiar to me after working with Nuxt.js. 

Here are a couple of notes about my work: 

- With the mockup, I'd usually ask a few more questions to make sure I get it all correct. I work best with a working file from XD or Sketch so I can get the fonts/sizes and colors that the designer wanted. But I tried my best to get close to the colors and just defaulted to Arial with the font, but it's easy to update with whatever. 
- With the Next.js framework, I didn't have too much trouble with anything, except maybe the form handling. This might be the only point I really noticed the difference between Vue and React... I miss model binding. :) 
- I can't think of anything else I might want you to know, it was all very straightforward and I enjoyed putting this all together for you!
